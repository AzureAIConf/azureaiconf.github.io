As a Principal technical PM Manager, I am the platform runtime and service owner two Azure Services - Service Fabric Azure Cluster service and Azure Service Fabric Mesh service (https://aka.ms/sfmesh). My passion is to build and operate products and services involving Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems and Storage that meets the needs of small and large enterprise applications at scale. I have a proven leadership track record in understanding customer/ business needs and successfully managing complex issues in the areas of product development, go-to-market strategy, public release and day to day operations of cloud-scale services. Over the years, I have been deeply involved in vendor relations, negotiations, technical infrastructure, design, development, testing, quality control, quality Assurance, post production support, service level agreements and application change control regimes as well.
