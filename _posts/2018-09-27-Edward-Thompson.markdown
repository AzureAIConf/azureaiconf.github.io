I'm a Program Manager for version control in Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services and the co-maintainer of the libgit2 project, the Git repository management library that underpins tools like GitHub, Visual Studio and Xcode. I also develop version control tools and I also write and speak about Git and version control.
